Corporate real estate platform UX documents, data, code, and results
This is the repository for a research project I did for a corporate real estate company. Data is anonymized and simulated to approximate the actual data collected in the project without identifying the client, customers, and users. 
Files include:
a) Data dictionary
b) codebook
c) draft of the survey instrument (original was implemented in Qualtrics)
d) Original dataset pulled from Qualtrics
f) Recoded dataset as used in the analysis
g) Various python and SQL code used in the simulation, dataset preparation, and analysis
